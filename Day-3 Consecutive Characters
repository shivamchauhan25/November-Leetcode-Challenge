Consecutive Characters

Given a string s, the power of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Return the power of the string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
Example 2:

Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
Example 3:

Input: s = "triplepillooooow"
Output: 5
Example 4:

Input: s = "hooraaaaaaaaaaay"
Output: 11
Example 5:

Input: s = "tourist"
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 500
s contains only lowercase English letters.

Solution:
Python:

class Solution:
    def maxPower(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        max_count = 0
        previous = None
        for c in s:
            if c == previous:
                # if same as previous one, increase the count
                count += 1
            else:
                # else, reset the count
                previous = c
                count = 1
            max_count = max(max_count, count)
        return max_count
