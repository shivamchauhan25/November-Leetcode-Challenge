Valid Square

Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, return whether the four points could construct a square.

The coordinate (x,y) of a point is represented by an integer array with two integers.

Example:

Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: True
 

Note:

All the input integers are in the range [-10000, 10000].
A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles (90-degree angles).
Input points have no order.


Solution:
C++:
class Solution {
public:
    // helper function to calculate distance between two points
    double dist(vector<int>& p1, vector<int>& p2) {
        return sqrt((p2[0] - p1[0]) * (p2[0] - p1[0]) + (p2[1] - p1[1]) * (p2[1] - p1[1]));
    }
    
    bool validSquare(vector<int>& p1, vector<int>& p2, vector<int>& p3, vector<int>& p4) {
        // keep points in an array to be able to get them by index
        vector<vector<int>> points = {p1, p2, p3, p4};
        set<double> lengths;
        
        for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {
            for (int j=i+1; j<4; j++) {
                double curr = dist(points[i], points[j]);
                if (curr != 0)
                    lengths.insert(curr);
                
                // if distance is zero - we got a duplicated point
                else
                    return false;
            }
        }
        // We are supposed to end with only two different lengths: the sides and the diagonals
        return lengths.size() == 2;
    }
};
